<p style="text-align:justify">I obtained my Ph.D. of Cyberspace Security  from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2024, where my advisor was Prof. Chen Gong. Previously, I obtained my M.E. of Electronics and Communication Engineering from USTC  in 2019, and B.E. of Electronic Information Engineering from Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2016. My <b>research interests</b> lie in <b>Information Security</b>, <b>Signal Processing</b>, and <b>Wireless Communication</b>.  Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss or collaborate!</p>

- **Secrecy Performance**: Analyzed insecure region, strictly positive secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability under surface fluctuation, refraction and underwater scattering in dynamic water-to-air optical wireless communication (OWC) scenarios.

- **Secrecy Scheme**: Proposed a physical layer security scheme  based on channel randomness, correlation between uplink and downlink, and signal diversity to prevent information from being cracked.

- **Covert Scheme**: Proposed a covert transmission scheme based on a secret selection of narrow waveband signal, device characteristics, and strong ambient radiation to prevent attacks on communication links.
