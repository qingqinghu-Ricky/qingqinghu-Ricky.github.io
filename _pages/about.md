<center>I obtained my Ph.D. of Cyberspace Security  from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2024, where my advisor was Prof. Chen Gong. Previously, I obtained my M.E. of Electronics and Communication Engineering from USTC  in 2019, and B.E. of Electronic Information Engineering from Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2016. My research interests lie in Information Security, Signal Processing, and Wireless Communication.  Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss or collaborate!</center>
